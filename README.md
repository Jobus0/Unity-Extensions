# Unity Extensions
Handy extensions for general Unity development.

## About
This is a fairly large collection of extensions that I've accumulated over many years of Unity development. The goal is to reduce boilerplate code and simplify development without adding too much clutter, while being consistent with Unity's API style.

Nearly all extensions have XML documentation, except for where the method name alone is clear enough.

The extensions were written with performance in mind, and the few unavoidably slow methods that use [reflection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/reflection) have explicit warnings in their XML docuemntation.

## Installation
1. In Unity's Package Manager, press the "+" button.
2. Select "Add package from git URL...".
3. Put in: https://github.com/Jobus0/Unity-Extensions.git
